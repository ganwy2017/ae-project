About the notation:

- Q is the covariance for the noise in the motion model (like they use it in the
paper, contrary to the book).
- Rfeat is the covariance for the noise in the measurement model of the
features (when a robot measures a feature, as in lab1 and lab2).
- Rrobo is the covariance for the noise in the measurement model of the robots
(when a robot sees another robot).

Thoughts for the report:

- The update steps of the Kalman filter have been separated in observed and
observed (the robot saw another robot or was seen by another robot) so the
simulation represents better a real decentralized system.

TODO

- The non-initial update step for the robots that have not participated in the
measurement.

- Make in separate functions the computation of H_tilde, R_tilde
