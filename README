About the notation:

- Q is the covariance for the noise in the motion model (like they use it in the
paper, contrary to the book).
- Rfeat is the covariance for the noise in the measurement model of the
features (when a robot measures a feature, as in lab1 and lab2).
- Rrobo is the covariance for the noise in the measurement model of the robots
(when a robot sees another robot).
